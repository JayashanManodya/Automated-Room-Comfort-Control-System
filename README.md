🔻Automated Room Comfort System(Mini Project)

I'm excited to announce that my team and I have successfully finished our microcontroller-based hardware project: The Automated Room Comfort System.

📍Project Overview: Automated Room Comfort System

As part of our Fundermentals of Computing Module(1st Year 1st Semester) in BSc (Hons) in IT degree program, my team and I developed an Automated Room Comfort System that leverages IoT technology and microcontroller-based hardware to create a smart, energy-efficient environment. This system automatically adjusts room conditions based on sensor data and provides remote control capabilities via the Blynk app.

📍Key Features:

☑️Blinds Automation: Using a BH1750 light sensor, the system adjusts window blinds based on real-time light levels to optimize natural lighting and regulate room temperature. Depending on the lux levels, the blinds automatically open or close to maintain comfort and reduce reliance on artificial lighting.

☑️Temperature Control: The system monitors room temperature with a DHT11 sensor and activates a cooling relay if the temperature exceeds a set threshold, keeping the room comfortable without manual intervention.

☑️Humidity Control: With the DHT11 sensor, the system manages room humidity by controlling a humidifier and exhaust fan. The humidifier activates when humidity drops below the desired level, and the exhaust fan activates when humidity rises too high, maintaining an ideal balance.

☑️Blynk App Integration: The system is fully integrated with the Blynk app, enabling users to:
 ✔️Monitor real-time sensor data (lux, temperature, humidity) from anywhere.
 ✔️Manually control the blinds with a virtual switch, overriding the automated mode as desired.
 ✔️Toggle automation modes with a dedicated virtual switch, allowing users to enable or disable automation based on their preferences.
 ✔️Receive system status updates via LEDs, which indicate normal operation or potential sensor errors.

☑️Error Detection and Status LEDs: To ensure reliability, the system includes green and red LEDs for status indication. The green LED blinks to confirm normal operation, while the red LED alerts users to any system errors, such as sensor malfunctions.

📍Technology Stack:

☑️Microcontroller: ESP8266 for Wi-Fi connectivity and sensor integration.

☑️Sensors: DHT11 for temperature and humidity, BH1750 for light level measurement.

☑️Actuators: DC motor (controlled via L9110 motor driver) for blinds, relays for controlling the cooling system, humidifier, and exhaust fan.

☑️Software: Blynk app for remote control and monitoring, with C++ for programming the hardware components.
